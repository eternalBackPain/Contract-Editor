# Contract-Editor

## Overview

A code editor for lawyers drafting contracts. This editor will have the lawyer draft contracts in the same manner a software developer would code. It is simply a tool to draft contracts. The code will contain the drafting of a contract along with all the code necessary to format the contract. The human-readable contract will appear adjacent to your code and will live-update with every amendment to your drafting.

>"there is a crucial similarity between lawyers and programmers: the way they use words. Computer science and law are both linguistic professions. Programmers and lawyers use language to create, manipulate, and interpret complex abstractions. A programmer who uses the right words in the right way makes a computer do something. A lawyer who uses the right words in the right way changes peopleâ€™s rights and obligations. There is a nearly exact analogy between the text of a program and the text of a law.": [[grimmelmannProgrammingLanguagesLaw2022]]
